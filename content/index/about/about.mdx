I build creative and amazing things on the web. I'm a front-end engineer that loves ReactJS. I am deeply curious and intetrested in the applications of machine learning. 

I recently just completed my Bachelors in Computer Engineering with Honours. While at school I undewent 3 internships which introduced me to the world of development and I've loved it ever since. I also started working part-time during my final year and started particpating in hackathons. 
Focused and goal-oriented;  I have a good eye for detail and put in my best effort into time management and producing the best of results.

Currently, I freelance and enter some competitions on the side.
